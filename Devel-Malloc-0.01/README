Devel/Malloc version 0.01
==========================

Low-level memory operations: _malloc _memset _memget _free.
The _malloc() function allocates size bytes and returns memory address
to the allocated memory. You can store strings to memory using _memset() and
retrieve them using _memget(). The _free() function deallocates memory.

Memory address returned by _malloc() can be used between threads for
signal-based real time inter-thread communications.
