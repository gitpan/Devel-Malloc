Devel/Malloc version 0.03
==========================

Low-level memory and atomic operations: _malloc _memset _memget _free.
The _malloc() function allocates size bytes and returns memory address
to the allocated memory. You can store strings to memory using _memset() and
retrieve them using _memget(). The _free() function deallocates memory.

Memory address returned by _malloc() can be used between threads for
signal-based real time inter-thread communications.

Atomic __sync... operations also provided and can be used for lock-free
memory access and for low-level mutex creation.
